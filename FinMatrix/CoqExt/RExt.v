  remark    :
  1. possible reason of "field" failure
    a. notation "/", need unfold Rdiv first.
    b. unknown variable name, need be rewrite first.

  2. why need this library?
     (1) lots of properties are lack in standard library.
     (2) more automation, especially inequality.
     (3) We want to solve any problem of equality or inequality in one step.
  3. why auto fail? and how to better naming a term?
     (1) use two lemmas like A -> B and B -> A instead of A <-> B
     (2) x * x and x² are mixed, and x² is defined as x * x, and Coq Standard 
         Library prefer x², so we'd better choose x². But, notice that we should 
         rewrie x² to x * x before using ring or field, it's a bit annoying.
     (3) 1 and R1 are mixed, and 1 is (IZR (Zpos xH)), and will be reduced to R1
         finally, and Coq Standard Library prefer 1, so we choose 1 as well.
     (4) x - y and x + (-y) is same, but we prefer x - y.
     (5) x / y and x * (-y), we prefer x / y as well.

  4. Coq's support for automatic proofs of equalities and inequalities.

     (1) Micromega: a solver to solving arithmetic goals by ordered ring structure.
     (2). Psatz: a solver to solvign arithmetic golas on Q,R,Z,nat, and N.
     lia: linear, for integer (including Z,nat, and N)
     nia: non-linear, for integer
     lqa: linear, for rational number Q.
     lra: linear, for real number R and rational number Q.
     nra: non-linear, for real number and rational number.
     psatz D n: non-linear
     here, D is Z/Q/R, n is an optional integer representing search depth.
     (3). What's the ability of these solvers?
     It can solve the propositional formulas which its parameters are in the 
     field D∈{Z,Q,R}. The formulas are belows:
        p ::= c | x | -p | p+p | p-p | p*p | p^n
        A ::= p=p | p>p | p<p | p<=p | p>=p
        F ::= A | P | True | False | F/\F | F\/F | F<->F | F->F | ~F | F=F
        Here,
            c is constant in D,
            x is variable in D,
            -,+,* is subtract,addition,multiplication seperately,
            p^n is power of nat n,
            F are interpreted as Prop or bool.
       (a) If F is interpreted as bool, the corresponding operaters are:
           &&,||,eqb,implb,negb.
           And if D is Z, then the relations are: Z.eqb,Z.gtb,Z.ltb,Z.geb,Z.leb
           And if D is Q, then the equal realtion is Qeq (==), not eq (=).
       (b) the range of constant c,
           for Z and Q, c is all possible value could be get;
           for R, c is the expression below:
            c ::= R0 | R1 | IZR z | Q2R q 
                  | Rmult c c | Rplus c c | Rminus c c| Rdiv c c | Rinv c
