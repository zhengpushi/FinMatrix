# Here is a ToDo list.

## IMPORTANT, and EASY 
* To keep unified naming convension, caused by the ability of free use "A" after I have 
  renamed base type name from "A" to "tA", including:
  rename matrix variables from "M, N, P, O" to "A, B, C, D",
  also rename variables form "u,v" to something.

## EXPERIMENTAL WORKS
* FunMatrix project
  remove dependent type Fin
* PMatrix project
  high performance implementation.
